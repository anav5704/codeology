![hero](https://github.com/anav5704/codeology/blob/main/docs/codeology.png)

This is a blogging website I had made which also has a section for web development-related quizzes and live projects. The quizzes are coded using JavaScript and the projects are embedded using a third-party site(Codepen). Netflify CMS provides an admin pannel where blogs can be added and modified. 11ty is the static site generator and Nunjucks the templating language fo r this website. This was the first time I work with componenets and I was blown away. I migrated this project to Astro JS which is the cleaner, more performant version - [Codeology v2](https://github.com/anav5704/Codeology-v2).

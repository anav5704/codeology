            <h3>Basic computer Specs for Frontend Web Dev - 2023!</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Are you interested in learning front-end web development? If so, you're in luck! Front-end development is an exciting and dynamic field that involves building beautiful and interactive websites and web applications. As a beginner, it's important to start with the basics and gradually work your way up to more advanced topics. Fortunately, there are plenty of online resources available to help you learn front-end development at your own pace. With just a computer and an internet connection, you can start exploring the world of front-end web development and build your skills to create your own stunning websites. And just like building a website, learning front-end development takes time and effort, but the rewards are worth it in the end! This blog will go over the basic computer specifications required for beginner level front end web development. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Central processing Unit (CPU)</p>
            <p>Your computer's central processing unit, or CPU, is its mind. It is in charge of carrying out all the commands contained in the software you use, including the web development tools you'll require. A Processor with several cores and a high clock speed is perfect for web development. This is due to the fact that web development tools frequently use a lot of CPU resources. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Consider acquiring a CPU with at least four cores and a clock speed of 3.0 GHz or higher if you're buying a new computer. This will guarantee that your computer can manage several tasks at once without latency. Consider replacing your current CPU with a more potent one that has more cores and faster clock rates if you're updating your current machine.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Random Access Memory (RAM)</p>
            <p>Your computer's short-term memory is known as RAM, or Random Access Memory. Your computer keeps the data that is presently being used in this location. It is crucial to have a lot of Memory when developing websites. This is due to the fact that web development tools need a lot of RAM to function properly.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Consider getting at least 8GB of RAM if you're buying a new computer. By doing this, you can prevent your computer from sluggishly handling many applications at once. Consider increasing your Memory to at least 8GB or more if you're upgrading your current machine.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Storage</p>
            <p>Your computer's storage is where all of your files and data are kept. In order to keep your projects, code, and other data, you'll need a lot of storage capacity when it comes to web development. Solid-state drives (SSDs), which have faster read and write rates than conventional hard drives, are becoming more and more popular.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Consider acquiring an SSD with at least 256GB of storage if you're buying a new PC. By doing this, you can be sure that you have enough room for all of your projects and data. Consider switching your hard drive to an SSD if you're updating your current computer for quicker read and write performance.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</p>
            <p>Although a strong graphics card is not required for frontend web development, having one is still a good idea. Your computer's graphics card is in charge of rendering pictures and videos. A strong graphics card might aid in accelerating the rendering process while working with high-resolution images or videos.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Consider obtaining a dedicated graphics card with at least 2GB of VRAM if you're buying a new PC. By doing this, you can handle any graphically demanding tasks without experiencing any latency. Consider replacing your outdated graphics card with a more potent one that has at least 2GB of VRAM if you're updating your PC.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Display</p>
            <p>Also necessary to front-end web development is a nice presentation. You must be able to clearly view every piece of your work when building a website. For web development, a display with a high resolution and outstanding colour accuracy is crucial.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Consider acquiring a display with at least a 1080p resolution if you're buying a new PC. For even more detail, you might also think about purchasing a monitor with a higher resolution, such 1440p or 4K. Consider replacing your current monitor with a higher resolution model that has good colour accuracy if you're updating your PC.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Web Browser</p>
            <p>You will see and test the websites and web applications you create using a web browser. The most widely used browsers by web developers are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari (latest version). To take advantage of the most recent features and security upgrades, it's critical to keep your browser updated in order to ensure compatibility with the newest web technologies.</p>
            <br>
            <p>BONUSES!</p>
            <p>In addition to the basic computer specifications mentioned above, there are also other factors to consider when setting up your frontend web development environment. These include:</p>
            <br>
            <p>A reliable internet connection is essential for web development, as you'll be constantly downloading and uploading files to servers. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Creating a comfortable workspace is also important, as you'll be spending a lot of time in front of your computer. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Finally, choosing the right text editor that suits you. suit your needs. The most popular one is VS Code as it is free, easy to use and has a large community. Some other text editors are sublime text, atom, and brackets.</p>

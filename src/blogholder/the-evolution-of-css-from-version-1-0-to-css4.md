You've probably worked as a web designer or developer before. In that case, you have probably seen CSS change over time. CSS has come a long way from its early, unassuming days in the 1990s to its present status as a vital tool for web design. So join me as we journey through CSS's history, from the debut of CSS 1 to the cutting-edge features of CSS 5, and take a trip down memory lane. Prepare yourself to be amazed at how far web design has come!



## CSS 1: The Birth

To distinguish between a web page's presentation and content, CSS 1 was first released in 1996. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created it to offer a standardised method of styling web pages. CSS 1 gave designers control over fundamental styling components like font, colour, and spacing. This was a significant development in web design because it gave designers more freedom and control over how a website looked and felt. Prior to CSS, HTML was used to style web pages, but HTML had much fewer design options. By introducing a uniform method of web page styling that was available to all web developers, CSS 1 paved the way for the future of web design.



## CSS 2: The Innovation

An update to the original CSS specification, known as CSS 2, was released in 1998. It added new capabilities like improved handling of fonts and colours, media type support, and the ability to precisely position elements. Additionally, the introduction of selectors allowed programmers to concentrate on specific elements and apply styles to them. By separating presentation from content and making website upkeep and updates easier, these developments revolutionised web design. Designers could now create more complex layouts and intricate page designs. CSS 2 is still a vital part of web design today and made modern web development possible.



## CSS 3: The Present

As new modules are created and approved by the CSS Working Group, they are added to CSS 3. CSS 3 was first released in 1999 to add new features and improvements to CSS. Advanced typography, animations, transitions, and better element positioning and layout are all supported. With media queries, flexible box layout, and more advanced visual effects like gradients and shadows, CSS 3 gives developers the ability to create responsive designs. This improves website performance by lowering the demand for images and HTTP requests. These developments have revolutionised web design by making it simpler for designers to produce visually appealing and engaging websites.



## CSS 4: The Future?

The most recent set of modular specifications, CSS4, speaks to the state of CSS right now and where it's going. There isn't a single official specification, and some of the modules are still in the form of draughts or suggestions. Selectors level 4, custom properties, grid layout, and level 4 media queries are features of CSS4 that are frequently mentioned. Level 4 selectors introduce new methods for focusing on elements based on their characteristics, conditions, or connections. Authors can define and reuse their own variables in CSS by using custom properties. Media queries level 4 enable more precise control over responsive design, while grid layout offers a flexible way to create two-dimensional layouts.



## Thatâ€™s it!

In conclusion, CSS has advanced significantly since its creation in the 1990s, and each new version has brought about noticeable advancements. The idea of separating content from presentation was first introduced by CSS 1, layout and positioning features were later added by CSS 2, and many contemporary design elements, including gradients, animations, and responsive layouts, were introduced by CSS 3. Although CSS 4 has not yet been officially released, its proposed features look promising and will help web designers and developers continue to advance their skills. What CSS will look like in the future is impossible to predict, but one thing is certain: CSS has revolutionised web design and will undoubtedly continue to do so in the years to come.

Hello, newbie! Your journey into the world of web development is about to get wild. Ever wonder how websites are developed? It's likely that if you're reading this, you're ready to learn more about HTML, the foundation of the web. Hypertext Markup Language is what HTML stands for, which is a mouthful, but don't be concerned! We're here to explain it to you in a humorous and interesting manner. You'll be able to build your own web pages by the end of this article and dazzle your friends with your growing coding expertise. So let's explore the wonderful world of HTML while enjoying a cup of coffee or tea.



## What is HTML? 

Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is the building block of every website you visit. Web developers use this markup language to organise and format content on the internet. The creation of headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and other web page components is made possible by HTML. It enables a website's text to be read, its images to be seen, and its links to be clickable. We couldn't browse the internet or access the vast amounts of information and entertainment that are available online without HTML. To put it simply, HTML serves as the foundation of the internet, so learning it is the first step towards becoming a web developer. One important thing to note in that HTML is a markup language as compared to C++ and JavaScript which are programming languages.



## HTML Elements and Tags

HTML is made up of several basic building blocks, including tags, attributes, and elements. Tags are the main components of HTML, and they are used to define the structure and content of a web page. They are enclosed in angle brackets, like this: <tag>. Attributes provide additional information about an HTML element, and they are written within the opening tag. For example, the 'src' attribute in the <img> tag tells the browser where to find the image file to display on the page. Finally, elements are made up of both the opening and closing tags, along with the content in between. For example, the <p> tag denotes a paragraph element, and any text or other content written between the opening and closing <p> tags will be displayed as a paragraph on the web page. Understanding these basic building blocks of HTML is essential to creating effective and well-structured web pages.



## HTML Document Structure

The head and the body are the two main sections that make up the fundamental structure of every HTML document. The page title, links to external stylesheets, and meta data about the page's content are all found in the head section of the document but are not visible on the web page itself. The head section usually appears at the start of the document, between the <head> and </head> tags. The body section includes the text, images, and other HTML elements that make up the website's actual content. When a web page loads, this section, which is typically found between the <body> and </body> tags, is what is visible in the browser window.





## Creating Your First HTML Document

It can be intimidating to create your first HTML document from scratch, but once you know the basics, it's actually quite easy. Create a new document by opening a plain text editor, like Notepad or TextEdit. Type in the following:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Webpage title here</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Webpage heading here</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

To view the finished product, save your document with an.html extension and open it in your web browser. You can create your first HTML document using these easy steps and get started learning about web development.



## Best Practices for Writing HTML

"There are a few best practices you should adhere to when writing HTML code to make sure that your code is clear, effective, and maintainable. To make your code more readable and understandable, start by using indentation and appropriate spacing. Additionally, to enhance your website's SEO and accessibility, use semantic HTML whenever possible. Use comments to also give other developers working on the same project context for your code and to explain its purpose. Additionally, it's a good idea to use descriptive class and ID names, group-related elements, and keep your code organised. Last but not least, verify the validity of your code using a validator like the W3C Markup Validation Service.



## That’s It!

You are now an HTML wiz, congrats! You have already taken the first step towards becoming one, if not quite yet.
